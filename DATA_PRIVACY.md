# Data Privacy Principles

## Introduction

Aequus is built with privacy by design. We believe that conflict resolution requires trust, and trust requires strong privacy protections.

## Data We Collect

### For Mediation Sessions
- **Conversation Data**: The content of the mediation sessions is stored temporarily and encrypted end-to-end. Only the parties involved and the assigned mediator (if any) have access.
- **Metadata**: We collect minimal metadata such as session duration, participant count, and outcome (success/failure) for improving our services.

### For User Accounts
- **Identity**: We do not require real names. Users are identified by their decentralized identifiers (DIDs).
- **Contact Information**: We do not require email or phone number unless for account recovery (optional).

### For AI Training
- **Anonymized Data**: We may use anonymized and aggregated data from mediation sessions to train our AI models. All personally identifiable information is removed.

## Data Usage

We use data solely for the purpose of providing and improving our conflict resolution services. We do not sell data to third parties.

## Data Storage and Encryption

- **Encryption in Transit**: All data is encrypted in transit using TLS 1.2 or higher.
- **Encryption at Rest**: All stored data is encrypted using AES-256.
- **Decentralized Storage**: We use decentralized storage solutions (IPFS, Arweave) to avoid single points of failure.

## User Rights

- **Right to Access**: Users can access their data at any time.
- **Right to Deletion**: Users can delete their account and all associated data.
- **Right to Portability**: Users can export their data in a standard format.

## Changes to This Policy

We will notify users of any material changes to this policy via our website or platform.
